							<h3>Jumpstart #8: Significance</h3>
							<p>This jumpstart is designed to help writers understand the significance of their ideas. When writers often get stuck during writing, they lose the significance of their writing and how to convey that to their readers. This jumpstart is a five minute verbal free write which writers can use in order to answer two questions; why their writing is significant to them, and what will their writing help readers think about differently.</p>
								<p>The images to the right are stills from the video which show what the writer will be viewing when they watch the video. The video was done using white board animation and the audio was taken courtesy of Dr. Annelise Heinz's original video.</p>

			<h2>Why Jumpsarts?</h2>
			<p>Jumpstarts were designed to be quick, simple, and productive in order to support the writing process. </p>

					<h3>Designing Jumpstarts</h3>
					<p>Dr. Annelise Marie Heinz developed Jumpstarts during her time as a professor in the Stanford Teaching Commons.</p>
					<p> Dr. Heinz noticed that students would more often struggle with putting words down on paper, rather than the post-production phase. Many solutions and methodologies exist to aid in the editing process, but far fewer tools are available to overcome stalls in the production phase. As a means to help her students, Dr. Heinz developed Jumpstarts.
					</p>
					<p>Jumpstarts was designed with two ideas in mind: to make students see writing as a dynamic process of creation, and to more effectively support writers in the production phase.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="4u 12u(narrow)">
					<h3>Writing Insights</h3>
					<p>Embracing writing as a process of thinking rather than a linear procedure of recording pre-formed ideas encourages writers to embrace the “stuck spots” that they run into.  When writers encounter difficult patches, many feel the instinct to go into a more passive mode, whether that means reading scholarly literature or checking Facebook.</p>
					<p>However, if writing is a process of thinking, then it is essential to force active engagement with those stuck spots in order to create the ideas that can then get hashed out and later edited.  This process requires producing so that multiple possibilities can emerge and ideas can enrich each other.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="4u 12u(narrow)">
					<p>It is an often-messy process that is not supposed to be linear.  It requires temporarily turning off the “pruning” instinct and forging ahead.  Stuck spots aren’t sand traps in this scenario; they are fertile opportunities for writers to break new ground.</p>
					<p>It’s not enough to think about writing-as-a-process-of-thinking in the limited sense of words on paper.  Even writers who try desperately to work through those stuck spots often find themselves staring interminably at a computer screen.  They are then stuck in their ideas and stuck in one form of processing.  To overcome this, jumpstarts emphasize various modes of production to work through ideas.  Writing is only one; others might involve talking or drawing.  Each prompt ends, however, with the explicit goal to turn whatever ideas have been generated into words on the page.</p>
